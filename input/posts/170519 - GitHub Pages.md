GitHub.com offers static web page hosting called GitHub Pages.
The mechanism is simple:
by creating a repository named [kaosborn.github.io](https://github.com/kaosborn/kaosborn.github.io),
a site at that [URL](https://kaosborn.github.io) with the content of the repository is created.
Content may copied literally or be generated from the repository with the Jekyll site generator.

However, GitHub seems to be abandoning Jekyll leaving new users to write their own site from scratch
or find a tool to generate their own pages.  Here is a ranked list of static site generators:

This blog is currently generated by the static content generator [Wyam](https://wyam.io).
It is unclear at this time where GitHub is going with their blog hosting strategy.
Jekyll is half abandoned and any future replacement GitHub tooling should be considered
if and when GitHub closes this gap.
